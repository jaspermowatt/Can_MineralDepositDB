<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: regional geology) The area is underlain by detrital rocks of the San Antonio Formation, which include pebbly arkose, arenite to subgreywacke, and arkoses with pebbles of volcanic rocks, quartz, quartz diorite and chert (Fig. 39-1; A.F. 92536). Beds can be recognized using thin pebbly layers as markers, but top directions were not recognized. The San Antonio Formation was interpreted as an alluvial fan deposit characterized by a north to south facies change from pebbly arkose to subgreywacke (A.F. 92788). 
</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: mineralization) - The San Antonio Formation hosts radioactive elements in the Bissett area. The uranium minerals uranophane and pitchblende, preferentially associated with pebbly arkose, are widespread.
- Surface sources of radioactivity apparently corresponds with various multidirectional fracture systems and several northwest-trending fault zones, distributed along the western margin of the San Antonio Formation. An apparent spatial relationship between uranium mineralization and a discontinuous conglomeratic layer near the base of the San Antonio Formation is interpreted as suggesting that uranium may have been initially concentrated as a heavy mineral placer either within, or adjacent to, the conglomerate (A.F. 92788).
- Concentrations of radioactive compounds at the surface are related to fractures that are parallel or at a low angle to bedding. Major instances of high level radioactivity were found to coincide with slickensided quartz-filled faults. Anomalous radioactivity was also found in extension and shear fractures of diverse orientation.
- Locally, fractures are coated with limonite and bound by oxidized pink-grey zones, extending for several centimetres into grey-greenish, pyritic, detrital rocks. Uranophane is rarely observed on weathered surfaces, but is common along fractures in freshly blasted rock.

</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: property geology) Dome Exploration (Canada) Ltd. recognized 7 zones of anomalous radioactivity in the area west of Horseshoe Lake.
- Site #1: Radioactivity in this area is primarily associated with east- northeast-striking, steeply dipping extension fractures. Minor radioactive anomalies were also detected in several additional fractures. 
- Site #2: This zone consists of a radioactive anomaly associated with rocks adjacent to a 15 m long fracture. 
- Site #3: This is the aerially largest (35 x 20 m) occurrence of radioactive compounds observed in the Bissett area. Radioactivity is associated with a quartz-carbonate-filled fault that truncates bedding at a low angle. DDH 15-2 was drilled under the northwest end of this site. 
- Site #4: This zone of high radioactivity is associated with a quartz-carbonate-filled strike-slip fault that strikes 100° azimuth. Radioactivity levels tend to increase in the wall rocks up to 50 cm from the fault. This fracture was investigated by DDH 15-5. 
- Site #5:  Anomalous radioactivity levels are highest in a fine grained dark grey sandstone in the vicinity of a conglomerate bed. The intensity of the radioactivity is highest of all showings in the Bissett area. DDH 15-3 was drilled to test this radioactive anomaly at a depth of 20 m. 
- Site #6: Radioactivity is associated with extension fractures oriented at high angles to the foliation and at low angles to bedding. Some radioactivity is associated with 2-3 mm wide bands of pyrite occurring at an angle to foliation, which may represent primary heavy mineral concentrations along the bedding plane. 
- Site #7: This area located south of Horseshoe Lake consists of numerous small fractures, some coated with limonite and uranophane, in a 150 x 80 m area. The highest degrees of radioactivity were observed in rocks containing 2 to 3 mm thick black bands which were preferentially radioactive. 
</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: rock analysis and sample assays) - Grab samples collected in 1969 for Dome Exploration (Canada) Ltd. contain <=0.45% U3O8 and trace ThO2. Chip samples from selected radioactive anomalies contained from 0.01% to 0.40% U3O8 over short intervals. Dome also drilled the radioactive zones: DDH 15-2 on site #3 intersected 1.5 m and 2.5 m long zones that contain 0.02% U3O8 and two 2.5 m long zones that contain 0.1% U3O8.  DDH 15-5 near site #4 intersected 7.5 m of continuous uranium mineralization that included a 4.5 m intersection averaging 0.05% U3O8.  DDH 15-4 intersected 3.5 m containing slightly more than 0.01% U3O8.  DDH 15-3, drilled to test site #5, intersected a 1.5 m zone containing 0.01% U3O8. (A.F. 91129, 92788).
- Drillholes by the Union Oil Company of Canada Ltd. intersected several intervals with elevated uranium contents, the highest of which are from DDH 79-2, which contained 0.07% U3O8 over 2.59 m, 0.042% U3O8 over 1.52 m, 0.052% U3O8 over 1.28 m and several other short intersections of lower grade. DDH 79-1 intersected rocks that contain 0.037% U3O8 over 1.06 m and several additional small anomalies (A.F. 92742).
</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) - An experimental AEM (INPUT) survey was conducted under contract to the Geological Survey of Canada (A.F. 91543) over the area in 1968. The area was examined in 1969 by Dome Exploration (Canada) Ltd. for its potential to contain economic concentrations of uranium. Airborne and ground radiometric surveys outlined radioactive anomalies W and S of Horseshoe Lake, which were mapped at 1:4 800, trenched, and sampled; 5 holes (529  m) were drilled (A.F. 91129, 92536). The stratigraphy, sedimentology and structure of the San Antonio Formation was studied by Dome in 1970 (A.F. 91126, 92536) to gain an understanding of the stratigraphic controls. A combined AEM and MAG survey was flown by Geoterrex Ltd. in 1970 (A.F. 91681) and an airborne radiometric survey was flown by Geophysical Engineering and Surveys Ltd. in 1971 (A.F. 91677). The Union Oil Company of Canada Ltd. signed an option agreement with Dome Exploration (Canada) Ltd. and undertook 1:4 800 geological mapping, soil-, rock-, water- and lake bottom silt geochemical surveys and radiometric surveys in 1978 (A.F. 92788). This work was followed with an I.P. survey and a 5 hole (662 m) drilling program in 1979 (A.F. 92742). 
</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: geochemistry) The uranium in these rocks is extractable by leaching with hot nitric acid, which indicates that little of the uranium is contained in refractory oxide minerals (A.F. 92788). </span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: genetic model) According to staff of Dome Exploration (Canada) Ltd., the uranium originally concentrated in a placer type deposit and was subsequently redistributed throughout the pebbly arkose by tectonism and fluid migration. Groundwater may have also played a role in the final uranium distribution (A.F. 92536).
