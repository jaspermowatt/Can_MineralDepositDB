<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) Native silver was found in 1932. Surface and underground work were carried out during early 1930s by White Eagle Mines Limited (Parsons, 1948, p.9-10; Lord, 1951, p. 91; Lang, 1952, p. 56-57). An adit extends for 60 feet from beside the Camsell River north shore, and then turns northwest to follow No. 1 vein for a distance of 490 feet. From approximately 200 feet from the junction of the adit and No. 1 vein a cross-cut was driven northeast for a distance of 105 feet. From this cross-cut, at a distance of 105 feet, at a distance of about 50 feet from the main drift, a winze was sunk to a depth of about 125 feet. The property was idle until 1946 when A.V. Giauque restaked it  and a new company, namely Camsell River Silver Mines, was formed. The new LM claim group  covers at least part of the former OTTER and AVG groups, which include the main veins and underground workings. The company carried out surface stripping, geological mapping and diamond drilling of 1750 feet in 26 holes (Parson, 1948, p. 9-10). The drilling outlined an ore shoot 250 feet long, 46 inches wide with an average grade of about 34 oz/ton Ag (Thorpe, 1972, p. 78-80). A sample taken at the intersection of the adit and No. 1 drift contained 7.38 oz of Ag and 0.226 % U3O8 (Parsons, 1948, p. 9-10). In 1967 Fred Lypka and Associates mined some material from the surface along the main vein and bagged an estimated 4 to 6 tons of silver ore. The shipment of the ore was later reported have averaged 438 oz/ton Ag (Thorpe, 1972, p. 79). In 1968 Fred Lypka, the registered owner of the property, optioned it  to Grayling Mines, which apparently lead to takeover by Silver Bay Mines, and eventually in 1970 by the Federated Mining Corporation Limited. During 1968 Silver Bay Mines drove a new adit 100 to 120 feet east of the old adit to intersect the old drift on the No. 1 vein, which dips 70° to the northeast. Slashing was done on the drift to permit use of rubber-tired loader-trammer, and raises were put to exploit the wedge-shaped ore shoot. During the period 1971-1977 production from the Silver Bay (White Eagle) mine totalled 7758 tons (7038 tonnes) of ore milled (Strand, 1996).</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: mineralization) The main No. 1 vein consists of quartz and quartz-carbonate veins along a shear-breccia zone striking N 60 to 80° W, and dipping 70° to the northeast. It outcrops 30 feet north of adit portal. It comprises a network of stringers commonly 0.5 to 6 inches wide. It pinches and swells from several inches to 2 feet. In places it is heavily mineralized with pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena and silver minerals. The host rock is basaltic andesite volcanics of the Labine Group, which are gently folded about an axis trending WNW. Feldspar and quartz feldspar porphyry dykes belonging to the Labine Group and trending northeast, cut the andesitic volcanics. The mineralization occurs in tension fractures in the axial zone of the syncline. In addition to No. 1 vein there are smaller parallel veins. The No. 2 vein is located 600 feet to the northeast and dips 75 to 80° to the southwest. Two smaller veins occur 170 and 220 feet, respectively, to the northeast of No. 1 vein, and are cut by a pyrite vein trending N 55° E. A smaller quartz vein about 370 feet to the northeast at the edge of drift valley, and contains some minerals with pyrite and chalcopyrite. Radioactivity in the veins is detectable by scintillometer, although the proportion of pitchblende is small. Badham (1975, p. 167-168) interpreted the veins as filling the easterly fractures between two NE-trending master faults. He noted that mineralogy of these veins is similar to that of the Terra mine veins, but the main difference is in the paragenesis. It is marked the occurrence of silver before as well as after the sulphides and bismuth at Silver Bay, whereas they are later in the  terra veins. </span></td></tr>
