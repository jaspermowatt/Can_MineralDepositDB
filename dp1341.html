<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) This property was first staked in 1940s as YAW group. In 1960 surface exposure of a polymetallic vein (~ 65° 36' 14" N and 118° 06' 45" W) was discovered by a prospector working for Eldorado Mining and Refining Ltd. Four holes totalling 942 feet were drilled to test it, two of which intersected Ag and Cu values, with highest assay of 20 oz Ag/ton over 10.3 feet. In 1963 Echo Bay Mines Limited optioned the property and carried out additional drilling. The property was dormant until 1966 when northern part of the former YAW claims ground was restaked by Carl Sutton as 'A' group of 21 claims, and Silver Bear Mines Limited was formed. Assets of the company were taken over the following year by Terra Mining and Exploration Limited. The exposed vein was described by Thorpe (1972, p. 170), who visited it in 1966, as 14 inches wide traceable for 10 feet in northeast direction across a gossan zone in mineralized sheared tuff horizon, and the complex mineralogy of it was described by Harris and Thorpe (1969). Further drilling in 1967 totalled 9306 feet in 31 holes, which outlined several parallel en echelon veins of good grade that cut across the calc-argillite unit over its 400 feet strike zone trending northwest and dipping steeply to the northeast. Part of the drilling directed at the depth extension of six silver veins showed they persisted to 300 feet. By the end of 1967 a decision was made to test the mineralization by underground development. The company announced an estimate of mineable reserves of 700 tons per vertical foot to a depth of 415 feet, with average grade of 32 oz/ton Ag, 2.5 % Cu, 0.5 % Co and 0.5 % Bi. Sinking of an inclined shaft (adit) at 17% grade started in April 1968, and was driven 1200 feet to reach the main zone, and then 600 feet of drifting at that level was completed and a 393-foot raise was punched to the surface. During 1969 a 300-ton per day mill was completed, which began production of Ag-Bi and Ag-Cu concentrates. In 1971 the underground haulage way was extended 850 feet to open third level about 450 below surface. Ore reserves in 1972-'73 were 30852 tons grading 119 oz/ton Ag. In 1973 the decline was extended to fourth level about 600 feet below the surface. The ore was mined from # 7, 8 and 9 veins on the upper three mine levels. The mill was averaging 170 tons/day and mill heads were averaging about 70 oz/ton. Since up to 70 % of the silver in the ore is in native form, a 'jig concentrate' containing 4000 to 5000 oz/ton Ag was obtained following the first pass through the ball mill. The remainder of the ore passed through the floatation units, where 'bulk concentrate' containing about 1000 oz/ton Ag and 15 % Cu was produced. The jig concentrate was flown out and the bulk concentrate was transported on ground to railhead at Hay River. During 1974-'75 silver ore was mined from veins 10 and 11 up to 700-foot level where high grade shoots occur. During 1977 to 1983 the company brought ore from its Norex mine situated 7 km to the southeast by road. In 1978 vein # 13 was discovered by drilling north of the known veins. It contained some pitchblende as do other veins like # 54, 55 and 56 on the northeast shore of Rainy Lake reached by underground workings. Their pitchblende content was however not high enough to make economic recovery of uranium, as seen from treatment of couple of thousand tons of ore from these veins in 1979. In 1980 the company entered in agreement with Procan Exploration Company in Calgary, owned by Hunt brothers (Nelson, Bunker and Herbert) of Houston, which allotted $ 35 million for exploration in exchange for 50 % stake in the mine. Intensive exploration done in 1981-'82 added little to the ore reserves. Procan terminated the agreement in exchange for remainder of the investment and part of the property on north of Rainy Lake. Terra mine closed in 1985.                                                                                                                               </span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: mineralization) Production came from high grade native silver-cobalt-bismuth-nickel arsenide shoots in quartz-albite-carbonate veins.</span></td></tr>
