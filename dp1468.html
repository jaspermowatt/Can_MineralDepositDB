<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: mineralization) Trenching and sampling of the most prospective zones completed in 1955 returned assays from 0.13% to 4.00% U3O8. Further sampling in 1965 included chip samples of 0.05% U3O8 over 26 feet and 0.132% U3O8 over 10 feet. Several zones of brecciated, altered granodiorite with a stockwork of quartz stringers were encountered in the drilling and some of the altered zones in hole 2 assayed 0.03 to 0.11% U3O8 over widths of 1.0 to 8.5 feet. An assay of the showing identified in 1975 returned an assay of 0.03% U3O8. Description from NORMIN.DB, June 19, 2007.</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) The anomalous area was discovered during a reconnaissance airborne radiometric survey in 1954, and Kix Minerals Ltd staked the relevant ground. During staking a zone about 25 feet wide and 150 feet long, open to both ends, was discovered. A gridded airborne radiometric survey with 660 foot line spacing was then completed over the property. During the 1955 field season the MAR property was prospected, geologically mapped, and trenched. Several pitchblende-bearing zones were identified. The claims were allowed to lapse and were restaked in 1965. Giant Yellowknife Mines Limited made a preliminary examination of the claims and carried out scintillometer surveys, geological mapping and sampling in the area. Giant drilled 3 holes totalling 1002 feet in 1967 to explore the downward extension of the surface showings. In 1975 the ground was restaked by Saratoga Exploration Ltd as the DM claims. The claims were mapped and prospected using scintillometers. A zone of low-grade, finely disseminated pitchblende was discovered in a fault zone to the east of the previously identified mineralization. Description from NORMIN.DB, June 19, 2007.</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: property geology) - The claims are located in the Bear Structural Province's southern extremity near the Slave Province boundary and are underlain by pegmatites, granodiorites and syenites. The rock is cut by steeply dipping northerly striking faults, which host several uranium showings. Rocks outcropping on the property consist of argillaceous and granitized sediments cut by granite and quartz stockwork. Large rafts of sediments are mapped in the granite. A large faulted zone extends northward through the centre of the property. This is a major structure of the area and extends for many kilometres and is characterized by abundant shearing, quartz vein stockwork, and brecciated fragments of host rock. There appears to be at least three events of quartz flooding in the fault zone. 
- The westernmost of 2 faults on the property is marked by a quartz stockwork having a width of over 100 feet. At the east contact of the zone the quartz and adjacent brecciated granodiorite country rock are mineralized over a width of 100 feet for a length of at least 700 feet. Pitchblende and Uranophane occurs as fracture fillings in the quartz stockwork. This mineralization is concentrated in the footwall of the fault zone.
