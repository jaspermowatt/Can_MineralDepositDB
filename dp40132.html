<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) A variety of surveys were conducted by Westmin Resources Ltd. (formerly Western Mining Ltd. of Canada) in the 'Area 2 of Interest' owned by the company, which includes the ITZA 4 claim of the Itza group of claims. Initial surface exploration in 1976 included lake bottom geochemistry, and regional geological mapping during 1976 and 1978, and an airborne radiometric and EM survey by Geoterrex in 1978. Prospecting in 1980 led to the discovery of a boulder (boulder VS-30, site# 1247) of the Amer Group siltstone that assayed 10400 ppm U (0.88 % U3O8), and a number of weakly  radioactive boulders of Thelon Formation (Nicholls and Stewart, 1981, Fig. 4b and 13). Four exploratory vertical diamond drill holes were completed in Area 2 during 1980. Hole 80-2-01 located about 3 km west of boulder train at latitude 65° N, went through 141 m of indurated Thelon quartzose sandstone of eolian origin, and intersected Showing Lake Formation below it. A thin (15 cm) regolithic zone separates these rocks from more steeply dipping (~30°) beds of purple mudstones interbedded with pink, purple and buff sandstone with medium to coarse sand grains. The siltstones predominate over sandstones and deposition was in tidal cycles. Hole 80-2-02 located 4370 m northeast of the first hole intersected 106 m of quartzite before it encountered the rocks resembling the Showing Lake Formation. Although the quartzite was initially thought to be indurated Thelon Formation quartzite, a petrographic study by Young (1980) showed that it is part of the Itza Lake Formation and dips 20 to 30°. It is pink, purple and grey, and includes purple mud chips, dolostone bed and  conglomerate horizon, and locally purple porphyritic volcanic fragments. Hole 80-2-03 located 300 m southeast of the second hole intersected flat-lying Thelon Formation up to 104 m below which there is even grained grey-purple feldspathic sandstone and disturbed purple mudstone of Oora Lake Formation that dips about 30°. Hole 80-2-04 is located 1950 m northwest of the second hole and intersected the Itza Lake Formation all along its length dipping moderately to steeply. It is characterized by abundance of poorly sorted feldspathic sandstone and common occurrence of mud grade material. One of the implication of the observations on the drill holes is that the thickness of the Thelon Formation in the area immediately to the south of the boulders could range up to 130 m (Nutter and Nicholls, 1981). The basement comprises the Amer Group strata folded into a broad syncline as seen in the exposures 5 km to the northeast. Detailed lake bottom sediment and helium surveys, and prospecting in the radioactive boulder train area were carried out in 1981. Further exploration in the area during 1982 comprised prospecting, and VLF-EM, IP and magnetometer surveys. Prospecting located 22 additional radioactive boulders of feldspathic sandstone southeast (up-ice direction) from the original discovery of high grade boulder discovered in 1980. They are in zones of weakly anomalous (1.5 times background) radioactivity, located 400 to 750 m southeast of the high grade boulder (Ross, 1982). In 1984 additional prospecting and solid gas radon survey were completed (Nutter, 1984). The latter showed several small zones of anomalous radon values (3 to 6 times background) near southeastern end of the boulder train, thus indicating proximity to the source of the boulders located in the southwestern corner of ITZA 4 claim. This boulder zone was defined in detail in 1984 by the ground radiometric survey, geochemistry and geomorphological studies. Additional eight radioactive boulders were also located. The data indicate source of the boulders close to line 4+00 m E, 49+50 m S of a SE-trending grid (Kretschmar, 1984), which is taken here as the location for the occurrence. </span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: regional geology) The radioactive boulders are lithologically similar to those of the Oora and Showing Lake Formations of the middle part of Amer Group. The surrounding area is covered by overburden, but outcrops of Amer Group strata are found to the northeast and northwest, about 6 km from the zone of radioactive boulders. Unconformity with the overlying Thelon Formation is mapped in both outcrop clusters. The flat-lying Thelon Formation is poorly exposed elsewhere in the area. Four holes were drilled in 1980 to explore the unconformity (Nicholls and Stewart, 1981, Fig. 4b and 13).These diamond drill holes are located from the ITZA 4 boulders are as follows: Hole H-80-2-01 about 2 km to the west, which intersected 141 m of Thelon sandstone and Showing Lake Formation below it; H-80-2-02 about 1 km to the north, intersection 0 to 106 m was regarded as Thelon sandstone but relogging in 1981 by Ross (1982) showed that the entire hole was in Itza Formation; H-80-2-03 about 300 m southeast of hole 80-2-02, intersected 86 m of Thelon sandstone and Oora Lake Formation below it; H-80-2-04 located about 1.8 km to the northwest of hole 80-2-02 intersected only the Itza Lake Formation of the Amer Group. The Thelon Formation is white and red hematitic sandstone, and mostly kaolinitic.</span></td></tr>
