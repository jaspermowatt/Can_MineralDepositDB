<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) - The Deep Rose Project (NTS 66G) of Urangesellschaft Canada Ltd. (UG), started with permits issued in 1974 to Metallgesellschaft Canada Ltd. (one of the companies of the consortium holding UG) in NTS 66 G1 and G8. Since 1976 the Deep Rose lands have had  sub-project status referred to as Sandhills, Sandhills West and East, and later as Deep Rose Project. By 1980 the Deep Rose Project comprised entirely of claims. During 1978-'79 the regional exploration programs included airborne geophysical surveys and detailed ground surveys (geological, geochemical and geophysical) focussed on a 15 km long graphitic conductor in the Amer fold belt at the eastern boundary of the overlying Thelon Formation. Follow-up ground prospecting and mapping delineated several showings (79-1 to 79-8,  80-1 to 80-6, and SHE claim).                                                                                                         - The original Star Lake grid was established in 1979 in a geologically favourable environment and covered 1 x 1 km area. In 1980 grid extensions were added to cover open-ended soil geochemical anomalies delineated in 1979. The unconformity between Amer Group and overlying Thelon Formation to the southeast of the grid, where showing 79-3 is located at the north end of Star Lake, was covered by later extension of the grid. Quartzite of Ayagaq Lake Formation of Amer Group, basal Thelon Formation and the unconformity are well exposed at the showing. Anomalous radioactivity is found in the paleoregolith and in hematitic sandy matrix of conglomerates of basal Thelon Formation. The soil geochemical anomalies are believed to have been derived from these uraniferous sources. Ground VLF-EM survey outlined a very weak conductor representing southwest end of the strong 15 km long conductor trending northeast with a few jogs in the trend. It is displaced by a 010° left lateral fault and a 305° fault. The two faults meet in the south at Star Lake, which is about 1 km long in N-S direction and has two small east and west pointing arms in its middle part. Ground magnetic survey revealed weak anomalies in the grid area. </span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: regional geology) A noteworthy geological feature of in the grid area northwest of Star Lake is the excellent exposure of paleosol profile at the base of the Thelon Formation. The profile comprises chaotic melange of angular to rounded fragments (pebbles) of varying lithologies, all set in highly altered soft, hematized groundmass (Marlatt and Ernsting, 1981, p. 72). The zone is 2 m thick, and units above and below it are relatively unaltered. Several hundred metres away a steep paleoslope contact of orthoquartzite overlain unconformably by quartz arenite of Thelon Formation shows absolutely no sign of alteration. These are the extremes in the nature of this unconformity, and implies that the paleoregoilithic profile in some places was either not developed or was eroded prior to deposition of Thelon Formation. Elsewhere in the western part of the Amer fold belt hematization in units just below the unconformity is common, and varies form local to extensive and faint to pervasive. Fault breccias and pockets of breccia comprised of subangular clasts set in hematitic red matrix are common close to the unconformity and predominate in the orthoquartzite terrain.                                  The northeast-trending conductors delineated by airborne VLF survey represent a unit of quartz-graphite-muscovite schist located at or near the base of the Lower Amer group orthoquartzite. Extensive thrust faulting is postulated to have occurred along this zone, often adjacent to carbonate-rich lithologies. Regional mapping  in the eastern part of the fold belt  (Heywood, 1977; Tippet and Heywood, 1978; Patterson, 1986) and in the Deep Rose project area by Urangesellschaft Canada Ltd., support interpretation of the faulting. It is also noted that the faults appear to have a component of right-lateral strike slip. Thrust faulting is also indicated in some tightly folded strata of the Amer Group from the structurally repeated sequences, and the presence of metamorphic minerals (tremolite, talc, dolomite) in some horizons indicative of hornfels facies (Marlatt and Ernsting, 1981).</span></td></tr>
