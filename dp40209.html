<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) Pitchblende veins on the west shore of Black Lake were discovered in 1948 by prospectors Roy Tobey and John Albrecht, working under the Saskatchewan Prospectors' Assistance Program. The showings area, namely the Nisto Concession, was acquired later that year by Transcontinental Resources Ltd. Its subsidiary, Nisto Mines Ltd., carried out prospecting and trenching in 1949, which located a number of radioactive veins in an area about 800x150 m with 43 m relief above the lake level. They were grouped in to 8 zones, and tested by 51 drill holes totalling 2663 m. During 1950-'51 two adits 200 m apart were driven from the lake side, with lateral work totalling 518 m. A raise was driven 45 m in the western (# 2) adit. By 1953 underground drilling amounted to 3749 m. In 1959 the property was leased to Haymac Mines for high grading ore. A total of 500 tons of ore was mined from the western adit, with one shipment of 106 tons (96.16 tonnes) of ore grading 1.63 % U3O8 (1.382 % U) to the Lorado mill near Uranium City. In 1966 Mokta Canada Ltd. conducted an airborne scintillometer survey in the area, and located a showing 2.4 km to the southwest, referred to as the South Showing. In 1968 a hole was drilled by Amok Ltd. near the Nisto or North showing on the east side of the Black Lake Fault. It was drilled at azimuth 306° and inclination of 69°, and intersected the Sub-Athabasca Group unconformity at 140 m. No radioactivity was encountered in the hole. Another hole near it was drilled by Eldorado Nuclear Ltd. and SMDC in 1979, on the south shore of the lake, but again no mineralization was intersected. Further geophysical surveys in 1980 along the Black Lake fault were also not encouraging. In 1996 the mine site was rehabilitated by placing radioactive rock, rails and ore cars in the adit. Adit portals and the stope at surface were sealed. A Geotem-EM survey was carried out over region in 1996 by JNR Resources Inc. The follow-up surface work was not encouraging.</span><br /><br /><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: mineralization) Uranium at Nisto deposit occurs in quartz veins and as fractures fillings in mylonitized granitic rocks and diabase dykes and sills. Hriskevitch (1949) described pitchblende distribution as coatings along planes in shear zones and along fractures adjacent to shears, and as fracture filling and replacement veinlets in quartz. Pitchblende veins as wide as 5 cm were noted, but narrower ones as more common. Reddish amorphous hematite is abundant in the pitchblende-bearing shears and adjacent wall rock. The mere presence of hematite however is no positive indication of the presence of pitchblende. Paragenetic relation of pitchblende with the sulphides is not clear. Carbonate, common in the pitchblende deposits of the Martin Lake and Goldfields areas of Saskatchewan, and of Great Bear Lake, is conspicuously absent or rare in the Black Lake area. Mafic host rocks show a marked bleaching, as much as a foot-wide on both sides of the pitchblende veins, which occupy tensional fractures, whereas the felsic wall rock show little or no alteration. Petrographic examination revealed that the bleaching is due to discoloration of biotite and alteration of biotite to chlorite. Mafic rocks appear to be more favourable hosts for pitchblende deposition than the felsic rocks. Since the Black Lake fault, to which the mineralized fractures are related, displaces the Athabasca Group, the mineralization post-dates the group. Homeniuk and Clark (1986, p. 238) suggested the possibility that this basement-hosted pitchblende deposit is the 'root' of an eroded unconformity-associated deposit. This possibility must be weighed against the upward displacement of the west side of the Black Lake fault, which must be significantly more than the 140 m depth of the sub-Athabasca Group unconformity encountered in a drill hole on the east side.</span></td></tr>
