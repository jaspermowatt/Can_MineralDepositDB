<td class="lefttop"><span class="all">(<span class="underlined">Applies&nbsp;to</span>: discovery and development) In 1976 Urangesellschaft Canada Limited conducted regional geochemical exploration in Permits 370-373 and 379-384, and a study of published aeromagnetic survey of the area. The geochemical surveys included determination of uranium, radium and radon in samples of lake sediment, overburden, and water. Radium-226 decays to Radon-222, which is an inert gas with half life of 3.8 days. Under equilibrium conditions dissolved radon in water reflects the radium content of lake sediments. Copper, lead and zinc were additional elements determined in the survey. The geochemical survey revealed a very strong anomaly of radon in water at Screetch Lake, which is about 1.5 km long, 300 m wide along a stream draining west to Thelon River 3 km west of the lake.. A cluster of radon in water anomalies occur southwest of the lake. The aeromagnetic survey interpreted was conducted during 1970 and 1971 by Spartan Aero Limited on behalf of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, Ottawa. It comprised flight lines at 1/4 mile spacing in northwest direction. Interpretation of the data indicate thickness of the flat-lying Thelon sandstone in the range of 500 to 1000 feet in the west half of the study area, and increasing rapidly from 1000 to 7000 feet eastward in the east half of the study area. The study also showed two sets of faults, one trending northeast and the other to the north-northeast. 

In 1977 a base camp was established on a larger lake 2 km north of Screech Lake for detailed exploration. Ground prospecting was done over area around the lake. Overburden samples from B1 horizon were collected from the Screech Lake grid. A 78 line km of VLF EM-16 survey was conducted, and an underwater spectrometer survey at Screech Lake also carried out. Other techniques tested were emanometry, alpha nuclear sticks and radon cups.

During 1978 further exploration included underwater scintillometer survey, lake sediment survey and also a helium isotope survey in the lake water. Scuba divers with scintillometer found several springs in lake bottom emitting voluminous flows of cold, milky waters from deep trenches and craters. These spring waters were characterized by high total counts and high U/Th ratio, and 7 water samples were collected from them for analyses of radio-elements. Two of these were highly anomalous in uranium. It was reasoned that most uranium in aquifer like this would be adsorbed onto suspended clays thereby failing to get into lake water. This suggested that ascending waters initially contained much more uranium than reflected in the sampled water. Four water samples from Screech Lake were sent to Dr. W.B. Clarke of McMaster University, a pioneer of the study of helium in lakes of Canada (Clarke et al., 1977). Screech #2 sample, collected from one of the underwater spring, had the highest helium concentration he ever seen, at approximately 80x background. He also stated that total helium was accumulated over a very short time, probably a few weeks.

In 1979 the company relinquished Exploration Permits for NTS 75-I-10 and 15, and staked the BART claims in the area of Screech Lake. Work during the winter included completion of a VLF EM survey over the lake, 3 test lines of gravity survey and a number of resistivity depth soundings. A more detailed sampling was also done during the year. Results of these surveys indicated a relatively strong anomaly in the southwest, corner of Screech Lake. In August 1979, one diamond drill hole was collared 250 m west of the northwest corner of Screech Lake. This vertical hole was drilled to a depth of 459 m and was still in the Thelon sandstone. It was stopped because of financial reasons, but recommendation to deepen the hole later was made, but that has not materialized.

In 2004 Ur-Energy Inc. staked the Screech Lake property along with the Gravel Hill to the south and Eyeberry Lake properties to the north. No work was done in 2004-'05 because of delay in land use permit.
